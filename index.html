            <p>I am currently a student at Thinkful Bootcamp living in Hawthorne, California.</p>
            <p>I was previously a college student at Loyola Marymount University studying Health and Human Sciences until I decided to make the switch to something I truly enjoyed: web development!</p>
            <p>Please feel free to <a href="mailto:joshuaialvarez06@gmail.com">contact me</a> after looking at my website!</p>

            <h3 class = "section-title" >About Joshua</h3>
            <p>During high school, I believed that I had a strong passion for anatomy and the human body. However, as I explored different interests during college, I fell in love with technology and everything that surrounds it. It was during this exploration that I found a love for coding and found myself on the Thinkful website.</p>
            <p>Now at <a href="http://thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>,  I find myself thinking about coding and creating web pages throughout the entire day. I have the goal of becoming an excellent front end developer for a company that gives me the opportunity! I have always loved working in a team- whether it was in sports or in my high school clubs.</p>
            <p>Some of my interests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing video games with friends.</li>
                <li>Watching YouTube videos of others coding.</li>
                <li>Building computers and customizing controllers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I am certain that I can provide an excellent co-worker and friend to those who choose to bring me in.</p>
